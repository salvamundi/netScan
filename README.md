# netScan

In order to view code change branch to master. This is just some issue that I can't get over due to my lack of experience with working around Github and PyCharm together.

netScan is a simple network scanner. Required argument is the host(s) (range) IP. If method is not specified it will automatically perform the ARP scan. Simple as that.
This project is just for educational purposes and provides me some learnings. However you may use that to perform the simpliest host discovery in your area network. More features will be added soon.
